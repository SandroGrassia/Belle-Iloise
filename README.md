# Belle-Iloise
### Project for an Arduino Mini based MIDI Talking Drum

I made this device in 2017; it's a MIDI controller thought to be used as a talking drum: make a sound tapping on the round pad, and choose a note or modulate the pitch bend by squeezing on the clothespin.
On top, three knobs allow to adjust the central note, pitch-span of the clothespin, volume. On the bottom side there are the on/off mini switch and MIDI-OUT 5-pins DIN socket.
The device runs with 2x1.5V AA batteries; a small voltage regulator steps the voltage up to 5Vdc required by the circuit.

The name comes from the metal case branded "la belle-iloise".

This Belle-Iloise was the second piece/version I made, more compact than the previous one; the assembly is very artisanal... And a little bit messy!

This picture shows the Arduino Mini, the small board without USB port, based on an ATmega328P.
