# Belle-Iloise
Project for clothespins-based MIDI Talking Drum, powered by an Arduino Mini (now retiered).

I made this device in 2017; it's a MIDI controller thought to be used as a talking drum: make a sound tapping on the round pad, and modulate the MIDI PitchBend command by squeezing on the clothespin. The device runs with 2x1.5V AA batteries.

The name comes from the metal case branded "la belle-eloise".

This Belle-Iloise was the second piece/version I made, more compact than the previous one; the assembly is very artisanal... And a little bit messy!

This picture shows the Arduino Mini, the small board without USB port, and based on an ATmega328P.
