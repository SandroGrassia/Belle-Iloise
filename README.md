# Belle-Iloise
Project for clothespins-based MIDI Talking Drum, powered by an Arduino mini (now retiered).

I made this device in 2017; it's a MIDI controller thuoght to be used as a talking drum: make a sound tapping on the round woodden pad, and modulate the MIDI PitchBend command pushing on the clothspin. The device runs with 2x1.5V AA batteries.

The name comes from the metal case from "la belle-eloise"
